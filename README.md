# This mod is still work in progress. 
#### Currently adds a Fortnite themed boombox, songs arent cropped like id like to but it works.
#### Iam planning to add additional boom boxes with meme songs and what not.
#### I made this mod to easily use custom songs with my friends and to quickly and easily realise song requests. We plan to use it with TooManyEmotes as dancing hard to stupid songs is a ton of fun. Maybe you find enjoyment in it too!

#### The guide from Alice from YourOwnPersonalBoombox made this small project possible for me. If you want to create your own mod his mod page is a good place  to start.
